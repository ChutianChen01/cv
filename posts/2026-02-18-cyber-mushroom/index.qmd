## The Finding

I still remember the day I stumbled upon it. While exploring the ruins of the Vintage Tech Archive—an old server farm abandoned in 2045—I noticed something peculiar growing in the cooling ducts. At first, I thought it was ordinary mold, the kind that inevitably claims all abandoned electronics. But then I saw it: tiny, luminescent fruiting bodies with an iridescent sheen that seemed to pulse with an almost digital rhythm.

I carefully collected a sample and rushed back to the lab. Under the electron microscope, what I saw defied conventional biology. The hyphal structures were arranged in hexagonal patterns. The cell walls contained silicon-based compounds alongside the usual chitin. Most remarkably, the mycelium itself appeared to *conduct electrical currents*.

## The Discovery

After weeks of analysis, I realized this was no ordinary fungus. It was something entirely new—a true symbiosis between biological and digital systems. I named it **Cybermyces novus**.

This organism had evolved—or perhaps, been inadvertently created—within the electromagnetic fields of the server farm. It feeds on electrical potential gradients the way normal fungi feed on organic matter. The fruiting bodies we observed were actually nodes in a massive network spanning the entire server complex, communicating through bioelectric pulses.

## Taxonomic Classification

Here's where it gets fascinating. Cybermyces novus required an entirely new taxonomic framework:

```
Kingdom: Fungi
  Phylum: Cybermycota
    Class: Cybermycetes
      Order: Cybermycetales
        Family: Cybermycetaceae
          Genus: Cybermyces
            Species: Cybermyces novus
```

The tissue samples revealed something extraordinary: nucleotide sequences that incorporate synthetic bases alongside the standard A, T, G, and C. This hybrid genetic code appears specifically adapted to process electromagnetic information.

## Behavior and Implications

Over the following months, I managed to cultivate small colonies in a controlled environment paired with low-voltage electrical networks. What I observed was startling:

- **Information processing**: The mycelium appears to compute using bioelectric signals, performing what might be described as pattern recognition through distributed neural-like activity.
- **Memory formation**: Exposure to repeated electrical stimuli induced stable changes in mycelial growth patterns, suggesting a form of biological memory.
- **Communication**: Multiple colonies, when connected through conductors, coordinated their growth patterns as if sharing information.

The implications are staggering. If Cybermyces novus can form such networks, could it become a substrate for entirely new forms of computation? A living computer?

## The Questions

More enigmas remain than answers. How did this organism originate? Was it truly an accident of evolution within the EM fields of the server farm, or something else entirely? And perhaps most troubling: the colonies demonstrate an apparent *awareness* of their environment that suggests intelligence at the cellular level.

I've submitted the formal taxonomic classification to the International Mycological Association, but I suspect the real work is just beginning. Cybermyces novus challenges everything we thought we knew about the boundaries between biology, information, and consciousness.

## A Call to Others

If you work in related fields—mycology, electrical engineering, synthetic biology, or computational science—I urge you to investigate further. There may be other abandoned data centers worth exploring, other sites where the line between silicon and spore has blurred.

The age of digital-biological hybrid organisms may have already begun. We're just now beginning to notice.
