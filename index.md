**ACADEMIC and RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**  
**Using Bacterial Growth Inhibition Screen (BGIS) to Elucidate Functions of Dark Proteins**	March 2024 – July 2025  
*Supervisor: Prof. Ferdinand Kappes*	Kunshan, China

* Selected human candidate dark proteins from databases in conjunction with AlphaFold protein prediction.  
* Constructed an inducible protein expression system with a GST tag.  
* Used BGIS to examine the presence of functional domains in the proteins.  
* Located the functional domain(s) by fragmenting the proteins and artificially mutating the sequence with error-prone PCR.

**Examination and Identification of Toxin and Antitoxin in *Clostridium* species**	June 2024 – August 2024  
*Westlake University. Visiting Student. Funded by Student Experimental Learning Fellowship (**SELF**) (a competitively awarded grant from DKU Office of Academic Services) Supervisor: Prof. Liang Tao and Dr. Qiankun Bai*	Hangzhou, China

* Examined a *Clostridium*\-derived set of toxin-antitoxins for their toxicity in *E. coli* and the interaction between the two proteins.  
* Conducted toxicity test on a series of toxins from the *Clostridium* family.  
* Designed Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) procedures towards the development of kits for commercial use of examining pathogenic microorganisms in humans and pets.

**Monokaryon Separation and Haplotype Identification of *Suillus***	August 2023 – December 2023  
*Student Researcher. Supervisor: Prof. Rytas Vilgalys and Dr. Lotus Lofgren*	Durham, USA

* Designed primers for distinguishing the mating type of *Suillus*. Separated monokaryon culture and did sequence analysis on PCR products to improve primer design, allowing subsequent genetic manipulation on the cells.  
* Worked on improving fungi live cell imaging to verify e monokaryon cultures.  
* Conducted fieldwork to collect and identify samples of local mushrooms, contributing to ongoing multi-omics studies.

**Development of a dsRNA-based Pesticide**	November 2022 – November 2023  
*DKU iGEM Team: Citrus Guard. Team member. Supervisor: Prof. Linfeng Huang*	Kunshan, China

* Designed and constructed a dsRNA expression system for dsRNA-based pesticide production.  
* Expressed the dsRNA and examined the interference efficacy on *Diaphorin citri* larvae.   
* Designed a cell-free dsRNA production system for large-scale dsRNA production.  
* Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to optimize system design and improvement of efficiency.

**Screening of Seven Chemical Candidates Using *Caenorhabditis elegans***	January 2022 – March 2024  
*Student Researcher, Summer Research Scholar (**SRS**) (a competitively awarded grant from DKU Office of Academic Services). Supervisor: Prof. Hyun-Min Kim*	Kunshan, China

* Conducted phenotypic analyses on *C. elegans* mutant strains to gain basic lab skills and familiarity with the process of phenotypic analysis.  
* Completed phenotypic analysis independently on wild type *C. elegans* treated with multiple chemicals used in traditional Chinese medicine. Compared the embryonic lethality and larval arrest rate to evaluate the effect of the chemicals on germ cell development.  
* Used DAPI staining and confocal microscopy to observe morphological changes of nuclei in the germ cells.  
* Acquired practical research expertise in a range of techniques including PCR, gel electrophoresis, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, immunostaining, and RNA interference in *C. elegans*.
